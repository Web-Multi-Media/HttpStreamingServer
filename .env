#During the ingestion process, two video layers are generated. It enables to switch between quality if the network is bad (using MPEG DASH)
#The lowest quality layer has a fixed bitrate and its resolution is equal to the input one divided by 2.
#The highest quality bitrate depends on the input resolution and therefore is relative.
#HIGH_LAYER_QUALITY should be set between 1 and 4, 1 is the lowest, 10 the highest. (For 1080p input,  1 =  2mb/s, 4 = 10mb/s, ..)
